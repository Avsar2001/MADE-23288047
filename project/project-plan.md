Impact of Forest Coverage on Urban Air Quality: A Global Analysis

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->

- How does forest coverage impact urban air quality across different regions of the world?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->

In this data science project, I aim to explore the impact of forest coverage on urban air quality across different regions of the world. Forests play a crucial role in regulating the environment, and understanding their influence on air quality can inform urban planning and environmental policies.

I utilize two datasets: one detailing forest area by country and another providing air quality indices for various cities worldwide. The primary question is: "How does forest coverage impact urban air quality across different regions of the world?"

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: World Forest Area

- Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/webdevbadger/world-forest-area/data
- Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/webdevbadger/world-forest-area/download
- Data Type: CSV

The dataset comprises 34 columns, encompassing detailed information such as the country name, country code, and the percentage of forest area as a proportion of the total land area. The dataset spans from 1990 to 2021, with individual columns representing the annual percentage of forest area for each year within this period.

### Datasource2: World Air Quality Index

- Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityaramachandran27/world-air-quality-index-by-city-and-coordinates/download
- Data Type: CSV

This dataset contains detailed information on various countries, including the number of cities, their geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), and different air quality indices recorded in 2021.
